% Tutorial for examining raw RT data from Kim et al, J Neuroscience (example from 
%  Figure 2) in reciprobit form
%
% Recall that the idea behind the LATER (Linear Approach to Threshold
%  with Ergodic Rate) model is that a saccadic decision is made when a
%  "ballistic" decision variable rises from a starting value to an ending
%  value at a constant ("ergodic") rate that is fixed for a particular
%  saccadic decision but varies as a Gaussian across decisions reaches a
%  fixed threshold.
%
% Because the rate of rise is distributed as a Gaussian, and the distance
%  traveled by the decision variable is fixed, we know that the amount of
%  time, representing the reaction time (RT), is just:
%
%  RT = distance / rate
%
% And thus RT is distributed as 1/rate, or an inverse Gaussian -- which is
%  the primary empirical observation that the LATER model was developed to
%  explain.

%% 1. Load the raw data
%
%
%   Each raw data file in data/data_mgl/F has the following vectors (in 
%    each case, columns are individual trials):
%     - decisionSum takes -1 if the decision was left side, and 1 if the 
%        decision was right side.
%     - labelSum takes 1 for trials after change point (TACP) 0, and 2 
%        for TACP 1, and 3 for TACP 2, and 4 for TACP 3, and 5 for TACP 4, 
%        and 0 for the rest. [NOTE FROM JIG: THIS IS HOW MY STUDENT TIM KIM
%        CODED THE DATA, SO I WANT TO KEEP IT IN THIS RAW FORMAT. HOWEVER, 
%        PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS CODING SCHEME SEEMS OVERLY CONFUSING; I
%        WOULD HAVE CODED IT AS 0 FOR TACP=0, 1 FOR TACP=1, ETC]
%     - numdirSum takes -1 if the sound was left side, and 1 if the sound 
%        was right side.
%     - percorrSum is 0 if the subject's answer was incorrect, and 1 
%        if the subject's answer was correct.
%     - syncSum is 1 if the current trial is a "pupil trial" and 0 if 
%        the current trial is "RT trial" [NOTE FROM JIG: IGNORED HERE]
%     - tRxnSum is RT measured by mglGetSecs, where the RT is defined 
%        as the time when the eyes leave the fixation window. 
%        The fixation window was defined as 30% of the height and width of 
%        the screen (32.31cm x 51.69cm).

%% Plot RT distribution

% Open a figure

% Define selection criteria ("L" for "logical array"):
%  1. Correct trials only (basic LATER model doesn't account for errors)
%  2. Remove outlier RTs (need to check with Tim Kim about the conditions
%        that gave rise to super-long RTs of ~4 s)
Ltrials = percorrSum == 1 & tRxnSum < 1.2;

% Binning for RT and 1/RT plots
rtBins  = 0:0.02:1.2;
rrtBins = 0:0.2:10.0; % cutting off long tail of express saccades

% TOP: ALL SELECTED TRIALS
%  LEFT: RT distribution
%  Note that:
%  1. This distribution combines conditions that we expect to have 
%     an effect on RT, which we will explore below
%  2. Nonetheless, it still has the basic shape we expect: a small subset 
%     of very short ("express") RTs, corresponding to the values to the
%     left of the mode; and then overall a long tail to the right,
%     indicating quite a few longer RT trials
subplot(5,2,1); cla reset; hold on;
plotLATER_histogram(tRxnSum(Ltrials), rtBins, 'RT (sec)')

%  RIGHT: Inverse RT distribution
%  To see that the long tail on the right is roughly equivalent to an
%     inverse Gaussian, plot a histogram of the inverse RTs. Now the express
%     saccades are a long tail to the right, and otherwise the distribution
%     looks pretty close to Gaussian
subplot(5,2,2); cla reset; hold on;
plotLATER_histogram(1./tRxnSum(Ltrials), rrtBins, '1/RT (sec)')

% Now loop through and plot for subjets of trials corresponding to (see Fig. 2
%  in Kim et al):
%  C_L,0:  Left choices, change-point trials
%  C_L,1+: Left choices, non-change-point trials
%  C_R,0:  Right choices, change-point trials
%  C_R,1+: Right choices, non-change-point trials

   Ltrials & numdirSum == -1 & labelSum ~= 1; ...

   Ltrials & numdirSum ==  1 & labelSum ~= 1];
